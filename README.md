# dotfiles
My dotfiles are managed by gnu stow or rcm. Both tools do the same thing, i.e. they replace specified config files with a symlink to a directory where 
the original files have been moved. Stow is older, has more options and is more general purpose. Rcm has specific options that allow it to 
do automatically things that stow would need additional manual steps - for example, separate setups for individual hosts.

I only use these tools for configuration files I alter myself, not those modified by linux applications.
